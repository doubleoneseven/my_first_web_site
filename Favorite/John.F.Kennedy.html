<p style="margin-top: 50px;"><h4>
We set sail on this new sea because there is new knowledge to be gained, <br>
and new rights to be won, and they must be won and used for the progress of all people. <br> 
For space science, like nuclear science and all technology, has no conscience of its own. <br>
Whether it will become a force for good or ill depends on man, and only if the United States <br>
occupies a position of pre-eminence can we help decide whether this new ocean will be a sea of <br>
peace or a new terrifying theater of war. I do not say that we should or will go unprotected <br>
against the hostile misuse of space any more than we go unprotected against the hostile use of <br>
land or sea, but I do say that space can be explored and mastered without feeding the fires of war, <br>
without repeating the mistakes that man has made in extending his writ around this globe of ours. <br>
There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its hazards are <br>
hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful <br>
cooperation may never come again. But why, some say, the Moon? Why choose this as our goal? <br>
And they may well ask, why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does <br>
Rice play Texas? We choose to go to the Moon. We choose to go to the Moon... We choose to go to the <br>
Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; <br>
because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because <br>
that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, <br>
one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win, and the others, too.<br>
